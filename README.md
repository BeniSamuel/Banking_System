# Banking System

## Overview
This is a simple banking system implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. The system includes core features like customer management, account handling, and transactions.

### Folder Structure
- **models/**: Contains the core classes representing the entities in the system.
- **services/**: Contains classes that handle business logic related to the models.
- **utils/**: Utility functions for validations and other common operations.
- **main.py**: The entry point of the application.

### Key Concepts
- **Encapsulation**: Each class contains its own data and methods, hiding the internal state from the outside.
- **Modularization**: The code is organized into separate modules to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Models, services, and utility functions are kept separate to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

### How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Navigate to the `banking_system/` directory.
3. Run `python main.py` to execute the example script.
4. Explore and modify the classes and methods to learn more about OOP in Python.
